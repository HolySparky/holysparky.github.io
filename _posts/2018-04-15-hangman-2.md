Here is the code that we already have

[hangman.py](https://github.com/ZionPF/python_class/blob/master/hangman/hangman_half.py?raw=true)

So far, here are the functions that we have:

* Load word file: loadWords()
* Choose random word: chooseWord(wordlist)
* Judge is the whold word is guessed : isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed)
* Get the guessed word like h_pp\_ : getGuessedWord(secretWord, lettersGuessed)
* Get available letters: getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed)

Also, you may want to make sure you have the word list as before:

## Sudo Code

Looking at the graph above, we could actually write some "sudo code" to show the logic:

```python

    lettersGuessed = []
    mistakesMade = 0
    availableLetters = ""
    
    # Print : Welcome to the game, Hangman!

    # Print: I am thinking of a word that is X letters long (X is the lenth)


    # While loop : when we still have guesses, keep the loop

        # Print: ---------------------
        
        # Print: You have X guess left (X is the remaining gesses)

        # Print : Available letters : XXXXX (call lettersGuessed to get them)
        
        # Ask: Please guess a letter: (user input guess letter)

        # If: letter already guessed:

            # Print: ops! You've already guessed that letter:

        # Otherwise: (it's a new letter)

            # Get the previous guessed word (use getGuessedWord)

            # Change the letter to lower case string use string.lower()

            # Add the guessing letter to lettersGuessed list

            # Get the new guessed word (use getGuessedWord)

            # Compare the guessed word with previous guessed word (If):
            # If old_guessed == new_guessed: (Not a good guess)
            
                # Print : Oops! That letter is not in my word: XXX
                # XXX is the guessed word

                # Count one mistake

            # Else: (It's a good guess)

                # Print: Good Guess: XXX
                # XXX is the new guessed word
                

            # Check if the word is guessed (use isWordGuessed)

                # Print: Congratulations, you won!

                # Break out of the loop 
    

        # Here goes outside the loop

        # Print: Sorry, you ran out of guesses. The word was else.

        # Print: Here is the secret: XXX (the secret word)


```
