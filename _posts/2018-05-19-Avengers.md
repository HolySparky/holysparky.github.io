You should have something like this by the end of the following two weeks:

## Related Files

You should download the following zip file and extract them :

This includes the following pictures:

And a text file to show the informations about heroes:

## How to draw



### Read cards file



* Cards aresaved in a file “cards.txt”

* name, power,intelligence, image (separated by ,)

* Read file, getdata

```python


cards = dict()
fhand = open('cards.txt')
for line in fhand:
    name, power, intelligence, image = line.strip().split(',')
    cards[name] = [power, intelligence, image]
    
```



### Show the cards


* Use register_shape or addshape 
* You can addgif picture as a shape!
* You can add acombo of coordinates as a shape: 

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.up()
t.ht()
screen = t.getscreen()
style1 = ('Arial', 14, 'bold')
style2 = ('Arial', 20, 'bold')


cards = dict()
fhand = open('cards.txt')
for line in fhand:
    name, power, intelligence, image = line.strip().split(',')
    cards[name] = [power, intelligence, image]
    screen.register_shape(image)
fhand.close()
```

### Print words

Use write() to write words, use style definition for different words.

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
style = ("Arial",14,"bold")
t.write("hello",font = style, align = 'center')
```

## To be done

Try to compose your code and make the following demo:
