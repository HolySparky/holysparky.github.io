## What you have so far:

Now you will be able to :



1. read from cards.txt
2. get data for each hero
3. use turtle to draw the picture of the hero
4. write the data under the picture

## Let's enhance!

### Randomly choose a hero

When player inputs “random”, pick a random card for him.
* Create a list of cards
* pick a random item from the list

```python
if card == 'random':
    card = random.choice(list(cards.keys()))
```

### Organise your code 

Organise you code to fulfil the following function:

* function name : choose_card
* input: 
	* card (string): the choosen card name (like ‘thor’)
	* cards (dict): the cards dictionary
	* pen (Pen): the turtle pen
	* xcor (int): x place of the hero drawing
	* ycor (int): y place of the hero drawing
* output:
	* the "score" of the chosen card
	* score = power + intelligence + speed
* what it does:
	* given the input, draw the chosen hero at the chosen place
	* return the score of the input card


```python

def choose_card(card, cards, pen, xcor, ycor):
    if card == 'random':
        card = random.choice(list(cards.keys()))
    if card in cards:
        stats = cards[card]
        pen.goto(xcor,ycor)
        pen.shape(stats[-1])
        pen.stamp()
        pen.setheading(-90)
        pen.forward(120)
        pen.write("Name: " + card, font = style1, align = 'center' )
        pen.forward(25)
        pen.write("Power: " + stats[0], font = style1, align = 'center' )
        pen.forward(25)
        pen.write("Intelligence: " + stats[1], font = style1, align = 'center' )
        pen.forward(25)
        pen.write("Speed: " + stats[2], font = style1, align = 'center' )
        score = int(stats[0]) + int(stats[1]) + int(stats[2])

    return score

```

### Call the function for a Duel ！

Call the above function for two players, to make a duel, like this:

![duel](https://github.com/ZionPF/python_class/blob/master/avengers/images/result.png?raw=true)

```python


while True:
    player_1 = input("Player 1 : ")
    player_2 = input("Player 2 : ")
    t.clear()
    s1 = choose_card(player_1, cards, t, -100, 100)
    t.goto(50,50)
    t.write("VS.", font = style2, align = 'center')
    s2 = choose_card(player_2, cards, t, 200, 100)

    t.goto(50,150)
    t.color('red')
    if s1>s2:
        t.write("Player 1 WIN !", font = style2, align = 'center')
    elif s1<s2:
        t.write("Player 2 WIN !", font = style2, align = 'center')
    else:
        t.write("DRAW !", font = style2, align = 'center')
```

## Add more hero

You can add other heroes you like in this game, it's quite easy and you don't even have to change your code !

1. change cards.txt to add a new line for a new hero
2. put the hero's picture (GIF format) in the same folder as your python code

here is an example when you added some "fun" heroes:

## Homework

1. Play against the Computer !
	* The computer is now player2
	* It choose card randomly
	* Play against it!

1. Card Game!
	* Make card choosing really like a card game
	* Each avengers can be chosen only once!
